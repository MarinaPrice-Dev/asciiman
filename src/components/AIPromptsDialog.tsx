  "I want to create a game similar to pacman, I would like to have a maze created using ascii characters only so we don't need to use any images. The height and width of the game should always be a pre-set size similar to the original pacman game. I want a character to represent pacman, and to move it around the maze using arrow keys. And I would like 4 different coloured ghosts that automatically chase you around the screen just like the original game. There should be bits of food scattered around the level to collect, and collecting them all should end the game with a success. Being caught by a ghost ends the level with a fail. Pacman can be represented by: C Ghosts: @ Food: . Maze walls: # Walkable parts of the maze can be represented with a space. Pacman and Ghosts should always be placed in the walkable parts of the maze Lets use Vite, React and Rotjs to do this and anything else you recommend",
  "when pacman moves around, he should eat the food (.), they will be replace with an empty space",
  "the ghosts should be free to walk around the maze, when walking they will always complete the path they are on until they hit a wall, or there is a gap in a wall they are walking past, then they can pick a new direction. they will only follow pacman when he is visible to them on the same path (represented by spaces and .).

  "add the current movement speed being used by the ghosts to this part of the code, and use this number to control the ghosts speed",
  "when a ghost is following pacman and they cant see pacman, at the end of their current direction, they should pick a new direction based on one which is more likely to bring them closer to pacman. Try to calculate this based on the angle of degree of pacmans current position relative to the ghost, and pick a directions that is closest to the angle of degree to pacman",
