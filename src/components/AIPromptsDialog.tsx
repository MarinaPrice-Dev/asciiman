  "I want to create a game similar to pacman, I would like to have a maze created using ascii characters only so we don't need to use any images. The height and width of the game should always be a pre-set size similar to the original pacman game. I want a character to represent pacman, and to move it around the maze using arrow keys. And I would like 4 different coloured ghosts that automatically chase you around the screen just like the original game. There should be bits of food scattered around the level to collect, and collecting them all should end the game with a success. Being caught by a ghost ends the level with a fail. Pacman can be represented by: C Ghosts: @ Food: . Maze walls: # Walkable parts of the maze can be represented with a space. Pacman and Ghosts should always be placed in the walkable parts of the maze Lets use Vite, React and Rotjs to do this and anything else you recommend",

        <Description>
          This game was an AI experiment. It was mainly made using Cursor (with manual setup of the infrastructure). I have included all the successful prompts that made this game.
          <br /><br />
          There were many failed prompts that were rolled back. The code is pretty awful to maintain as it does not follow the coding practices of experienced engineers, and it gets more difficult to prompt engineer as the codebase gets bigger. But it works.
